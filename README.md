MESSAGE FOR PACKIX:<br/>
I'm currently in the making of my first official tweak called Haptify it will add the ability to add haptic feedback to
anything. So, I just wanted to setup my account now so when I finish(within a week) it can be published ASAP. The only other
tweak on here was my demo tweak all it does is just add the battery percentage to every UIAlert that pops up it was
my demo so you can ignore it if you wish.
